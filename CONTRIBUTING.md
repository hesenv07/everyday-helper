## 📥 Contributing Guide

This package is open for contributions from everyone.  
If you want to add new hooks, utility functions, or improvements, please follow the rules below so we maintain a clean and stable toolkit.

### 🔧 What You Can Contribute

You may contribute:

- Reusable React hooks
- Pure utility/helper functions
- Shared constants or small modules
- Fixes or improvements to existing features
- Documentation updates

#### Important Requirements

- Each contribution **must work independently** (no external dependencies).
- Must be **general-purpose and reusable**.
- Must include **proper TypeScript types**.
- Must follow the existing folder structure:
  - `hooks/`
  - `utils/`
  - `constants/`
  - `lib/`

### 🛠 How to Contribute

1. Create a new branch from `main`.
2. Add your hook/function/module following the existing structure.
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` using the correct category.
4. Open a Pull Request.
5. PRs must use **Squash and Merge**.
6. After approval, your PR will be merged and automatically released through CI/CD.

### 📝 Commit Message Rules

These rules are **required** for the automatic release pipeline to work.

When squashing your PR, the commit message **must** follow Conventional Commits format:

### New Feature / New Hook
```sh
feat: added useLocalStorage hook
```
→ triggers a minor version bump

### Bug Fix
```sh
fix: corrected delay behavior in useDebounce
```
→ triggers a patch version bump

### Breaking Change
```sh
feat!: updated API for useToggle
```
→ triggers a major version bump

## Updating the CHANGELOG
Each PR must update CHANGELOG.md:

Use the correct category (Added, Changed, Fixed, etc.)
Follow the formatting already used in the file
Keep descriptions short and clear

## [Unreleased]

### Added
```sh
- `useLocalStorage` hook for persisting state in localStorage (#42)
```

### Fixed
